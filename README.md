# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

I developed the SQL Employee Tracker application to have an easy way for a company to interact with a database. By using inquirer, the user can interact with prompts to easily view different tables in the database, add departments and employees, and update employees roles. The database is constructed utilizing MySQL. Creating this application has helped me develop and improve my skills and knowledge using MySQL and inquirer.

## Usage

First, start the application by running `npm start` or `node server.js`. The user will then be greeted by a menu asking what option they would like to choose. The user can view departments, view roles, view employees, add departments, add employees, and update employees role. When view departments is selected, a table displaying all departments and their id's is shown. When view roles is selected, a table displaying all roles, their role id's, their salary, and the department they belong to is shown. When view employees is selected, a table displaying all employee names, their employee id's, their salary, the department they belong to, and their manager is shown. When add a department is selected, a prompt will appear asking the new departments name. When a name for the department is inputted, the department is created and added to the department table. When add an employee is selected, a prompt will appear asking the new employees first name, then last name, a list of roles will be available to choose for the employee, and a list of managers will be avaliable to choose for the employee. The new employee will then be added to the employee table. When update an employee role is selected, the user can select from a list of all employees, then the user can select from a list of all available roles to assign to the selected employee. The employees role will be updated in the employees table.
